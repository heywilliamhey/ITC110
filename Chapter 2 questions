1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you
write them? 
The two values of the Boolean data type are as follows, with upper case first letter
True
False

2. What are the three Boolean operators?
And, or and not
3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every
possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what
they evaluate to).
True and True is True.
True and False is False.
False and True is False.
False and False is False.
True or True is True.
True or False is True.
False or True is True.
False or False is False.
not True is False.
not False is True.

4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) 
False
not (5 > 4)
False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
False
(True and True) and (True == False)
False
(not False) or (not True)
True
5. What are the six comparison operators?
!=, <, >, ==. <=, >=
6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment
operator?
The equal operator == compares two values and evaluates into a Boolean.
The assignment operator = stores a value in a variable

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one.
 A condition is an expression used in a flow control statement that evaluates to a Boolean

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is
stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

if spam == 1:
print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
print('Howdy')
else:
print('Greetings!')
10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?
Press CTRL-C
11. What is the difference between break and continue?
The break statement will move the execution outside of the loop
The continue  will move the execution to the start of the loop

12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)
in a for loop?
They do the same thing

13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop.
Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using
a while loop.
a) for i in range(1, 11):
print(i)
b)

i = 1
while i <= 10:
print(i)
i = i + 1
14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how
would you call it after importing spam?
Spam.bacon()
